# **App Name**: Random Foodie

## Core Features:

- Restaurant Database: A pre-built list of restaurants with names, addresses, and suitable meal times (breakfast/lunch/dinner). Data is manually maintained and stored in JavaScript array or JSON format. All restaurants must have a Google Maps rating of 4 or higher and be located between Zhuei Station in Tamsui, New Taipei City, and Shilin Station in Taipei City.
- Random Recommendation Mechanism: The web app displays three blocks: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Each block has an independent 'Recommend' button. Clicking the button randomly displays a restaurant name suitable for that time slot. It avoids recommending the same restaurant twice in a row within the same time slot to improve user experience.
- Map Link: The recommendation result displays the restaurant name with a clickable link. Clicking the link opens Google Maps in a new tab, showing the restaurant's location.
- Simple UI: A clean and intuitive web interface that is easy to operate, mainly presenting three recommendation blocks and buttons.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use bright and inviting colors to represent different meal times (e.g., sunny yellow for breakfast, warm orange for lunch, cozy purple for dinner).
- Employ a clear and readable font for restaurant names and information.
- Use food-related icons to represent different cuisines or meal types.
- Design a clean and intuitive layout with prominent displays of restaurant suggestions and map integration.
- Use subtle animations to transition between meal suggestions and map displays.
